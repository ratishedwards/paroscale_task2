2. Write a multi-threaded application to process a really large file which has integer
numbers stored in it. Each thread should work on a separate section of the file and
should find out unique numbers from that section and add it to the global unique
number list. Each thread keeps adding the unique numbers from its section to the
global list. Make sure the unique number should not repeat in the global list.
At the end of processing the whole file, print the list of unique numbers from the
global list.
